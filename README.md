# LevelUp App Repository

This repository contains the code for **LevelUp**, a basic web application designed to help users track and improve their daily physical activities.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: The app allows users to upload a picture (as proof) of their daily activity, add a short comment, and keep a log to track progress. It's like a minimalistic version of Snapchat, focused on daily habits and activities.
- **Quick Development**: Built in just 1-2 days as a basic prototype, with plans for future enhancements whenever time permits.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS + TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive UI.
- **Backend**: A basic backend built with Python(DRF) for handling uploads and data storage.

## Future Plans
- Add more features like activity streaks, reminders, and analytics.
- Explore using a more robust backend with Flask or Go for better scalability.
- Improve the user interface with advanced features and smoother interactions.

This project showcases a quick prototype developed in minimal time, with scope for growth in the future.
